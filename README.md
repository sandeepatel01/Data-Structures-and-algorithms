## Contributing
Contributions are welcome! If you'd like to add more data structures, algorithms, or improve existing code, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (git checkout -b feature/improvement)
3. Make your changes and commit them (git commit -am 'Add new data structure')
4. Push to your branch (git push origin feature/improvement)
5. Create a new Pull Request.


## Usage

Feel free to clone or fork this repository and use the code as a reference or for educational purposes. Each data structure and algorithm is implemented in separate files for easy inclusion in your projects.

To compile and run the code, make sure you have a C++ compiler installed. You can compile an example file like this:

  ```bash
g++ -o main main.cpp
./main
